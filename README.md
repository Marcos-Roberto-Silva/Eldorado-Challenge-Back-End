# Welcome to the Eldorado-Challenge-Back-End

#### This application is a challenge where I created a simple program to manage devices.

#### The user can insert, delete and list a device by its id or get all list of devices.

#### To test the API functionality, download the aplication and execute `npm install` to install the dependencies.

#### In a terminal execute ´npx sequelize db:create´

#### Once the API running, insert the url `http://localhost:3000/api-docs/#/` on your preffered browser.
